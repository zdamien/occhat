1-1 chat system created as a coding test.  Program can start as a server or
as a client connecting to the server; the server was only required to
handle a single connection.  Sending message receipts was part of the
spec.

This is the first version, around a select loop.  I got FP-happy and
make closures to handle buffered reading through multiple loops, rather
than just threading a record through.  Program can block on writing; I
made a threaded version rather than try to fix that.


The network functionality is treated as a library; the UI side is pretty
minimal.

chatMain.ml
chatMod.ml  -- the chat module
chatMod.mli -- ^
Makefile
README
testChatMod.ml -- just calls a test function, which just tests the
  message header code


Ideally I'd make another pass to make the code more perfect, but I want
to move on.
